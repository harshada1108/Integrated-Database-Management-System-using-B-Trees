# Integrated-Database-Management-System-using-B+-Trees

Implemented B+ trees of order 4 to efficiently manage four databases: Aadhar, PAN-cards, bank accounts, and LPG subsidies. Three B+ trees are constructed based on Aadhar numbers, PAN numbers, and bank account details as keys. Each node in these trees is interconnected, allowing seamless traversal between Aadhar, PAN, bank account, and LPG data with just Log(N) operations. This approach ensures efficient data retrieval and range search functionalities, addressing the problem statement's requirements effectively.
